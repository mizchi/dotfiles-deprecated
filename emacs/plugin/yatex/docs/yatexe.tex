@chapter What is YaTeX?

  YaTeX automates typesetting and previewing of LaTeX and enables
completing input of LaTeX mark-up command such as
@code{\begin@{@}}..@code{\end@{@}}.

  YaTeX also supports Demacs which runs on MS-DOS(386), Mule (Multi
Language Enhancement to GNU Emacs), and latex on DOS.

@section Calling typesetter

  Typing @kbd{[prefix] t j}, the current editing window will be divided
horizontally when you invoke latex command, and log message of La@TeX{}
typesetting will be displayed in the other window; called typesetting
buffer.  The typesetting buffer automatically scrolls up and traces
La@TeX{} warnings and error messages.  If you see latex stopping by an
error, you can send string to latex in the typesetting buffer.

  If an error  stops the La@TeX{}  typesetting, this  key stroke will
move the cursor to the line where La@TeX{} error is detected.

@table @kbd
@item [prefix] '
@itemx ([prefix]+single quotation)

        @dots{} jump to the previous error or warning
@end table

  If you find a noticeable error, move to the typesetting buffer and move
the cursor on the line of error message and type @kbd{SPACE} key.  This
makes the cursor move to corresponding source line.

  Since @kbd{[prefix] tr} pastes the region into the file
@file{texput.tex} in the current directory, you should be careful of
overwriting.  The method of specification of the region is shown in the
section @xref{%#notation}.

  The documentclass  for typeset-region is the same as that of editing
file if you edit one  file,  and is the same as main file's if you
edit splitting files.

@node Calling previewer, Printing out, Calling typesetter, Typesetting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Calling previewer

  @kbd{[prefix] t p} invokes the TeX previewer.  And if you are using
xdvi-remote, which can be controled from other terminals, @kbd{[prefix] t
s} enables you to search current string at the cursor on the running xdvi
window.

@node Printing out,  , Calling previewer, Typesetting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Printing out

  When you type @code{[preifx] t l}, YaTeX asks you the range of
dvi-printing by default.  You can skip this by invoking it with
universal-argument as follows:

@example
        C-u [prefix] tl
@end example

@cindex typesetter

  To change the typesetting command, write

@example
        %#!latex-big
@end example

@noindent
anywhere in the source text.  This is useful for changing
typesetter.

@node Splitting input files, Static region for typesetting, Changing typesetter, %#notation
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Splitting input files

  And if you split the source text and
edit subfile that should be included from main text.

@example
        %#!latex main.tex
@end example

@noindent
will be helpful to execute latex on main file from sub text buffer.  Since
this command line after @kbd{%#!} will be sent to shell literally, next
description makes it convenient to use ghostview as dvi-previewer.

@example
        %#!latex main ; dvi2ps main.dvi > main
@end example

@noindent
Note that YaTeX  assumes the component  before the  last period of
the last word in this line as base name of the main La@TeX{} source.
The @code{%f} notation in this line is replaced by main file name, and
@code{%r} replaced by root name of main file name.  If you specify
@code{%f} or @code{%r}, YaTeX always ask you the name of main file at the
first typesetting.

  To make best use of the feature of inter-file jumping by
@kbd{[prefix] g} (see @ref{Cursor jump}), take described below into
consideration.

@itemize
@item You can put split texts in sub directory, but not in
 sub directory of sub directory.
@item In the main text, specify the child file name with relative path name
 such as \include@{chap1/sub@}, when you include the file in
 a sub-directory.
@item In a sub-text, write @code{%#!latex main.tex} even if @file{main.tex}
 is in the parent directory(not %#!latex ../main.tex).
@end itemize

@node Static region for typesetting, Lpr format, Splitting input files, %#notation
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Static region
@cindex static region
@cindex Fixed region

  Typeset-region by @kbd{[prefix] tr} passes the region between point and
mark to typesetting command by default.  But when you want to typeset
static region, enclose the region by @code{%#BEGIN} and @code{%#END} as
follows.

@example
        %#BEGIN
          TheRegionYouWantToTypesetManyTimes
        %#END
@end example

This is the rule of deciding the region.

@enumerate
@item
If there exists %#BEGIN before point,

@enumerate
@item
If there exists %#END after %#BEGIN,
@itemize
@item From %#BEGIN to %#END.
@end itemize

@item
If %#END does not exist after %#BEGIN,
@itemize
@item From %#BEGIN to the end of buffer.
@end itemize
@end enumerate

@item
If there does not exist %#BEGIN before point,
@itemize
@item Between point and mark(standard method of Emacs).
@end itemize
@end enumerate

  It is useful to write @code{%#BEGIN} in the previous line of \begin and
@code{%#END} in the next line of \@code{end} when you try complex
environment such as `tabular' many times.  It is also useful to put only
@code{%#BEGIN} alone at the middle of very long text.  Do not forget to
erase @code{%#BEGIN} @code{%#END} pair.

@node Lpr format, Editing %# notation, Static region for typesetting, %#notation
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Lpr format
@cindex lpr format

  Lpr format is specified by three Lisp variables.  Here are the
default values of them.

@table @code
@item (1)dviprint-command-format
        @code{"dvi2ps %f %t %s | lpr"}
@item (2)dviprint-from-format
        @code{"-f %b"}
@item (3)dviprint-to-format
        @code{"-t %e"}
@end table

  On YaTeX-lpr, @code{%s} in (1) is replaced by the file name of main
text, @code{%f} by contents of (2), %t by contents of (3).  At these
replacements, @code{%b} in (2) is also replaced by the number of beginning
page, @code{%e} in (3) is replaced by the number of ending page.  But
@code{%f} and @code{%t} are ignored when you omit the range of print-out
by @kbd{C-u [prefix] tl}.

  If you want to change this lpr format temporarily, put a command
such as follows somewhere in the text:

@example
        %#LPR dvi2ps %f %t %s | 4up -page 4 | texfix | lpr -Plp2
@end example

  And if you want YaTeX not to ask you the range of printing
out, the next example may be helpful.

@example
        %#LPR dvi2ps %s | lpr
@end example

@node Editing %# notation,  , Lpr format, %#notation

@end table

@noindent
and select one of the entry of the menu as follows.

@example
        !)Edit-%#! B)EGIN-END-region L)Edit-%#LPR
@end example

@noindent
Type @kbd{!} to edit @code{%#!} entry, @code{b} to enclose the region with
@code{%#BEGIN} and @code{%#END}, and @code{l} to edit @code{%#LPR} entry.
When you type @kbd{b}, all @code{%#BEGIN} and @code{%#END} are
automatically erased.

@noindent
The next message will show up in the minibuffer

@example
        Begin environment(default document): 
@end example

@noindent
by typing @kbd{[prefix] b}.  Put the wishing environment with completion
in the minibuffer, and @code{\begin@{env@}}...\@code{\end@{env@}} will be
inserted in the La@TeX{} source text.  If the environment you want to put
does not exist in the YaTeX completion table, it will be registered in the
user completion table.  YaTeX automatically saves the user completion
table in the user dictionary file at exiting of emacs.

At the completion of certain environments, the expected initial entry will 
automatically inserted such as @code{\item} for @code{itemize}
environment.  If you don't want the entry, it can be removed by undoing.

  If you want to  enclose some paragraphs  which have already been
written, invoke the  begin-type completion with changing  the case
of @kbd{b} of key sequence upper(or invoke it with  universal argument
by @kbd{C-u} prefix).
@cindex enclose region into environment

  The following example encloses a region with `description'
environment.

@table @kbd
@item [prefix] B D
@itemx (or ESC 1 [prefix] b D)
@itemx (or  C-u  [prefix] b D)

        @dots{} begin-type completion for region
@end table

  This enclosing holds good for the completing input by @kbd{[prefix] b
SPC}.  @kbd{[prefix] B SPC} enclose a region with the environment selected
by completing-read.

@section Section-type completion
@cindex section-type completion

  "Section-type completion" completes section-type commands which take an
argument or more such as @code{\section@{foo@}}.  To invoke section-type
completion, type

@table @kbd
@item [prefix] s
        @dots{} section-type completion
@end table

@noindent
then the prompt

@example
        (C-v for view) \???@{@} (default documentclass):
@end example

@noindent
will  show up in the  minibuffer.  Section-type La@TeX{} commands are
completed by space key, and the default value is selected when you
type nothing in the minibuffer.

  Next, 

@example
        \section@{???@}:
@end example

@noindent
prompts you the argument of section-type La@TeX{} command.  For
example, the following inputs

@example
        \???@{@} (default documentclass): section
        \section@{???@}: Hello world.
@end example

@noindent
will insert the string

@example
        \section@{Hello world.@}
@end example

in your La@TeX{} source.  When you neglect argument such as

@example
        (C-v for view) \???@{@} (default section): vspace*
        \vspace*@{???@}: 
@end example

YaTeX puts

@example
        \vspace*@{@}
@end example

@noindent
and move the cursor in the braces.

  In La@TeX{} command, there are commands which take more than one
arguments such as @code{\addtolength@{\topmargin@}@{8mm@}}.  To complete these
commands, invoke section-type completion with universal argument as,
@cindex number of argument

@example
        C-u 2 [prefix] s (or ESC 2 [prefix] s)
@end example

@noindent
and make answers in minibuffer like this.

@example
        (C-v for view) \???@{@} (default vspace*): addtolength
        \addtolength@{???@}: \topmargin
        Argument 2: 8mm
@end example

@code{\addtolength} and the first argument @code{\topmargin} can be typed
easily by completing read.  Since YaTeX also learns the number of
arguments of section-type command and will ask that many arguments in
future completion, you had better tell the number of arguments to YaTeX at
the first completion of the new word.  But you can change the number of
arguments by calling the completion with different universal argument
again.


  Invoking section-type completion with @code{[Prefix] S} (Capital `S')
includes the region as the first argument of section-type command.

  The  section/large/maketitle type completion  can  work at the
prompt for   the argument   of  other section-type   completion.
Nested La@TeX{}  commands are  efficiently read with  the recursive
completion by typing  YaTeX's   completion key sequence in   the
minibuffer.

@cindex ;

  Arrow  marks,  sigma mark and those signs mainly used  in  the
TeX's  math environment  are completed by  key  sequences  which
imitate the  corresponding symbols graphically.  This completion
only works in the math environment.  YaTeX automatically detects
whether the  cursor  located  in math environment  or  not,  and
change the behavior of key strokes @kbd{;} and @kbd{:}.

  By the way, we often express the leftarrow mark by `<-' for example.
Considering such image, you can write @code{\leftarrow} by typing @kbd{<-}
after @kbd{;} (semicolon) as a prefix.  In the same way,
@code{\longleftarrow} (@code{<--}) is completed by typing @kbd{;<--},
infinity mark which is imitated by @code{oo} is completed by typing
@kbd{;oo}.

  Here are the sample operations in YaTeX math-mode.

@example
INPUT                   Completed La@TeX{} commands
; < -                   @code{\leftarrow}
; < - -                 @code{\longleftarrow}
; < - - >               @code{\longleftrightarrow}
; o                     @code{\circ}
; o o                   @code{\infty}
@end example

  In  any case, you can quit  from image completion and can move
to the next editing  operation if the La@TeX{}  command you want is
shown in the buffer.

  @code{;} itself in math-environment is inserted by @kbd{;;}.  Typing
@kbd{TAB} in the midst of image completion shows all of the La@TeX{}
commands that start with the same name as string you previously typed in.
In this menu buffer, press @kbd{RET} after moving the cursor (by @kbd{n},
@kbd{p}, @kbd{b}, @kbd{f}) to insert the La@TeX{} command.

  To know all of the completion table, type @kbd{TAB} just after @kbd{;}.
And here is the sample menu by @kbd{TAB} after @kbd{;<}.

@example
KEY             LaTeX sequence          sign
<               \leq                    <

  Math-mode of YaTeX provides another image completion, Greek letters
completion in the same method.  After prefix @kbd{:}, typing @kbd{a} makes

  If you will find @kbd{;} or @kbd{:} doesn't work in correct position of
math environment, it may be a bug of YaTeX.  Please send me a bug report
with the configuration of your text, and avoid it temporarily by typing
@kbd{;} or @kbd{:} after universal-argument(@kbd{C-u}) which forces

  Tables for completion consist of three dictionaries; `standard
dictionary' built in @file{yatex.el}, `user dictionary' for your common
private commands, and `local dictionary' that is effective in a certain
directory.

  When you input the command unknown to YaTeX at a completion in the
minibuffer, YaTeX asks you with the following prompt;

@example
  `foo' is not in table. Register into: U)serDic L)ocalDic N)one D)iscard
@end example

@noindent 
In this menu, typing @kbd{u} updates your `user dictionary', @kbd{l}
updates your local dictionary, @kbd{n} updates only on-memory dictionary
which go through only current Emacs session, and @kbd{d} updates no
dictionary and throws the new word away.

  If you find this switching feature meaningless and bothersome, put the
next expression into your @file{~/.emacs}

@item Optional parameters (enclosed by []) of section-type commands

@end itemize

  Typing @kbd{[prefix] c} on one of above objects you want to change
brings a suitable reading function sometimes with completion.
Note: If you want to change the argument of section-type command that
contains other La@TeX{} commands, type @kbd{[prefix] c} either of
surrounding braces of the argument in order to make YaTeX ignore the
internal La@TeX{} sequences as an object of changing.  Anyway, it is
very difficult to know which argument position the cursor belongs because
the La@TeX{} commands can be nested and braces can freely emerge.  So keep 
it mind to put the cursor on a brace when you are thinking of changing a
complicated argument.

@node Killing LaTeX commands,  , Changing LaTeX commands, Changing and Deleting
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Killing La@TeX{} commands
@cindex Killing La@TeX{} commands

  @kbd{[prefix] k} kills the La@TeX{} commands sometimes with their
arguments.  Following table illustrates the correspondence of the invoking
position and what is killed.

@example
[Invoking position]             [action]
\begin, \end line               kill \begin,\end pairs
%#BEGIN, %#END line             kill %#BEGIN,%#END pairs
on a Section-type command       kill section-type command
on a parenthesis                kill parentheses
@end example

Note that when killing @code{\begin, \end} or @code{%#BEGIN, %#END} pair,
the lines @code{\begin, \end} or @code{%#BEGIN, %#END} exist will be
killed entirely.  So take care not to create any line that contains more
than one @code{\begin} or so.

While all operations above are to kill `containers' which surround some
text, universal argument (@kbd{C-u}) for these commands kills not only
`containers' but also `contents' of them.  See below as a sample.

@example
Original text:                  [prefix] k      C-u [prefix] k
Main \footnote@{note@} here.    Main note here. Main  here.

@noindent
on that item.

  YaTeX uses the value of  the variable @code{YaTeX-item-regexp} as the
regular expression to search item header  in  itemize environment.
If you make a newcommand to itemize terms(e.g. @code{\underlineitem}), put

@lisp
        (setq YaTeX-item-regexp
              "\\(\\\\\\(sub\\)*item\\)\\|\\(\\\\underlineitem\\)")
@end lisp
@cindex YaTeX-item-regexp

in your @file{~/.emacs}.  If you are not familiar with regular expression
for Emacs-Lisp, name  a newcommand  for  `itemize' beginning  with
@code{\item} such as @code{\itembf}, not @code{\bfitem}.

  This function reformats the @code{\item} into `hang-indented' style.
For example:

@example
itemize, enumerate environment:
       >
       >\item[foo] `foo' is the typical word for describing an
       >           arbitrarily written....
description environment:
       > \item[bar] When the word `for' is used as an arbitrarily
       >        word, `bar'  is bound to follow it.
@end example

  Note that the indent depth of an @code{\item} word and its descriptive
paragraph are the same in latter case.  If you want to use different
depth, invoke fill-paragraph at the beginning of non-whitespace
character(see below).

@section Filling paragraph
@cindex Filling paragraph
@cindex M-q

  Fill-paragraph is little bit adapted for La@TeX{} sources.  It retains from
filling in certain environments where formatting leads to a disaster such
as verbatim, tabular, or so.  And it protects @code{\verb} expressions
from being folded (The variable @code{YaTeX-verb-regexp} controls this).
Besides, putting cursor on the first occurrence of non-whitespace
character on a line changes the fill-prefix temporarily to the depth of
the line.

There are two help file, `global help' and `private help'.  The former
file contains the descriptions on the standard La@TeX{} command and is
specified its name by variable @code{YaTeX-help-file}.  Usually, the
global help file should be located in public space (@code{$EMACSEXECPATH}
by default) and should be world writable so that anyone can update it to
enrich its contents.  The latter file contains descriptions on
non-standard or personal command definitions and is specified by
@code{YaTeX-help-file-private}.  This file should be put into private
directory.

@section Online apropos

  `Online  apropos' is an  equivalent  of GNU Emacs's apropos.  It
shows all the documentations that contains  the keyword entered by
the user.

@section When no descriptions are found...

  If there is no description  on a command   in help files,  YaTeX

@cindex gmhist
@cindex command history
@cindex minibuffer history

  When you are loading @file{gmhist.el} and @file{gmhist-mh.el}, you can
use independent command history list at the prompt of preview command
(@kbd{[prefix] tp}) and print command (@kbd{[prefix] tl}).  On each
prompt, you can enter the previous command line string repeatedly by
typing @kbd{M-p}.

@section min-out
@cindex min-out

  @file{min-out}, the outline minor mode,  can  be used in yatex-mode
buffers.  If you want to use it with YaTeX, please refer the
file @file{yatexm-o.el} as an example.

@cindex customizable variables

  You can change the key assignments or make completion more comfortable
by setting the values of various variables which control the movement of
yatex-mode.

  For example, if you want to change the prefix key stroke from @kbd{C-c}
to any other sequence, set YaTeX-prefix to whatever you want to use.  If
you don't want to use the key sequence @kbd{C-c letter} which is assumed
to be the user reserved sequence in Emacs world, set
@code{YaTeX-inhibit-prefix-letter} to @code{t}, and all of the default key
bind of @kbd{C-c letter} will turn to the corresponding @kbd{C-c C-letter}
(but the region based completions that is invoked with @kbd{C-c
Capital-letter} remain valid, if you want to disable those bindings, set
that variable to 1 instead of @code{t}).

@subsection How the add-in function works

There are three types of add-in.

@enumerate
@item
Option add-in
@item
argument add-in
@item
enclosing add-in
@end enumerate

@dfn{Option add-in} returns the
La@TeX{}'s optional parameters such as optional strings after
@code{\begin@{ENV@}}, optional strings between a section-type command
and its first argument, and optional strings just after type
maketitle-type command.  The following illustrates the name of add-in
functions, where underlined strings are generated by add-in functions.

@display
\begin@{table@}[ht]		(Function name: YaTeX:table)
             ~~~~
\put(100,200)@{@}		(Function name: YaTeX:put)
    ~~~~~~~~~
\sum_@{i=0@}^@{n@}		(Function name: YaTeX:sum)
    ~~~~~~~~~~
@end display

  Obviously, the function name is decided by concatenating the prefix
`YaTeX:' and La@TeX{} command's name.

  Another add-in type is @dfn{argument add-in}, which completes arguments
for section-type commands.

@display
\newcommand@{\foo@}@{bar@}	(Function name: YaTeX::newcommand)
            ~~~~  ~~~
@end display

  When the section-type command is inputted, the function named by
concatenating `YaTeX::' and section-type command, is called automatically
with an integer argument which indicates which argument of section-type
command is being read.  Thus the add-in should determine the
job referring the value of its argument.

  @dfn{enclosing add-in} is for modifying and/or checking the region that
will be enclosed by section-type commands via @kbd{[prefix] S}.  An
enclosing add-in function will be called with two arguments, beginning of
the enclosed region and end of the region.  Suppose you want to enclose
the existing text @code{(a+b)/c} by @code{\frac{}}.

@display
a/c
|  |
A  B
@end display

You do set-mark-command at point A and then move to point B.  Typing
@kbd{[prefix] S} and input @code{frac} enclose the region like this;

@display
\frac{a/c}
@end display

Normally, the expression @code{a/c} is translated to
@code{\frac@{a@}@{c@}}. An enclosing add-in is useful for modifying
@code{/} to @code{@}@{}.

@subsubsection Defining `option add-in'

  If you want @code{@{|c|c|c|@}} for all @code{tabular} environment,

@lisp
        (defun YaTeX:tabular ()
          "@{|c|c|c|@}")

is enough.  If you want more complicated format, define as below.

@lisp
        (defun YaTeX:tabular ()
          "@{@@@{\\vrule width 1pt\\ @}|||@@@{\\ \\vrule width 1pt@}@}")
@end lisp

@noindent
Note that the character @code{\} must be described as @code{\\} in
Emacs-Lisp.  The next example reads the tabular format from keyboard.

        (defun YaTeX:tabular ()
          (concat "@{" (read-string "Rule: ") "@}"))

@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsubsection Defining `argument add-in'

  This section describes how to define the add-in function for
@code{\newcommand}.

  The first argument of @code{\newcommand} begins always with @code{\}.
The second argument is usually so complex that we can not edit them in the 
minibuffer.  Here is the created function considering this.

@lisp
        (defun YaTeX::newcommand (n)	;n is argument position
          (cond
           ((= n 1)			;1st argument is macro name
            (read-string "Command: " "\\")) ;initial input `\' 
           ((= n 2) "")			;do nothing when reading arg#2
           (t nil)))
@end lisp

  Note that when the `argument add-in' function return `nil', normal
argument reader will be called.

@subsubsection Defining `enclosing add-in'

  This section describes how to define the add-in function for
text enclosed by @code{\frac@{@}}.

  When enclosing the text @code{5/3} by @code{\frac@{@}}, you might want to
replace @code{/} with @code{@}@{}.  Enclosing function
@code{YaTeX::frac-region} is called with two arguments, beginning of
enclosed text and end of enclosed text.  The function is expected to
replace @code{/} with @code{@}@{}.  Here is an example expression.

@lisp
(defun YaTeX::frac-region (beg end)
  (catch 'done
    (while (search-forward "/" end t)
      (goto-char (match-beginning 0))
      (if (y-or-n-p "Replace this slash(/) with `}{'")
	  (throw 'done (replace-match "}{")))

@subsection How the function is called

  YaTeX calls the add-in functions for specified begin-type, section-type,
and maketitle-type command, if any.  `Option add-in' functions for
begin-type are called when @code{\begin@{ENV@}} has been inserted,
functions for section-type are called just before input of the first
argument, and functions for maketitle-type is called after maketitle-type
command has been inserted.  `Argument add-in' functions are called at each
entry of arguments for section-type commands.

@subsection Useful functions for creating add-in

  Many add-in functions for typical La@TeX{} commands are defined in
@file{yatexadd.el}.  Those are also useful as references.  Here are the
short descriptions on useful functions, where [F] means function, [A]
means arguments, [D] means description.

@table @kbd
@item [F]
YaTeX:read-position
@itemx [A]
Character list which can show up in the brackets
@itemx [D]
   Return the location specifier such as `[htb]'.  When
nothing is entered, omit [] itself.  If the possible characters
are "htbp", call this function as
@code{(YaTeX:read-position "htbp")}

@item [F]
YaTeX:read-coordinates
@itemx [A]
Base prompt, X-axis prompt, Y-axis prompt     (each optional)        
@itemx [D]
  Read the coordinates with the prompt ``BasePrompt X-axisPrompt:'' for
X-axis, ``BasePrompt Y-axisPrompt:'' for Y-axis, and return it in the form 
of ``(X,Y)''.  The default prompts are @code{Dimension}, @code{X},
@code{Y} respectively.

@item [F]
YaTeX:check-completion-type
@itemx [A]
One of the symbols: 'begin, 'section, or 'maketitle
@itemx [D]
  Check the current completion type is specified one and cause error if
not. The variable @code{YaTeX-current-completion-type} holds the symbol
according to the current completion type.

the disaster (I wonder what is it???).  So when you make some mistake, it
is recommendable to type @kbd{C-g} and start afresh.

@subsection Simple generator

  The latter generator is invoked by the next sequence.
@center @kbd{M-x YaTeX-generate-simple}
This generator can make both ``option add-in'' and ``argument add-in''
(@emph{refer the section add-in functions}
@ref{How the add-in function works}), whereas @code{YaTeX-generate}
cannot make ``argument addin''.

  For example, assume you have the LaTeX command as follows.

@example
	\epsinput[t](250,50)@{hoge.eps@}@{plain@}@{Picture of foo@}
	         (A)  (B)     (1)      (2)      (3)
	(A)Optional parameter to specify the position
	   One of t(top), b(bottom), l(left), r(right)
	(B)Maximum size of frame
	(1)1st argument is filename of EPS file
	(2)2nd argument indicates
		plain		do nothing
		frame		make frame around image
		dframe		make double-frame around image
	   for included EPS file.
	(3)Caption for the picture
@end example

  Now get start with generation.  Typing @kbd{M-x YaTeX-generate-simple}
brings the prompt:
@display
                (O)ption? (A)rgument?
@end display

@subsubsection Generating ``option add-in''
@cindex option add-in

  Since (A), (B) above are optional argument, all we have to do to
complete them is define the option add-in for them.  Let's generate the
function to complete (A).

@display
                M-x YaTeX-generate-simple RET
                epsinput RET
                o
@end display

@noindent
Typing as above leads the next prompt.

@display
Read type(1): (S)tring (C)omplete (F)ile ([)option (P)osition co(O)rd. (q)uit
@end display

@noindent
  This asks that ``Which type is the completion style of 1st argument?''.
Here are the possible completion style.

@table @code
@item String
read plain string
@item Complete
read with completion
@item File
read file name
@item Option
read optional string (if string omitted, omit [] too)
@item Position
read positional option (like [htbp])
@item Coord.
read coordinates
@item Quit
quit from generating
@end table

  Since (A) is the optional argument to specify the location of included
EPS file, the completion style is @code{Position}, and the possible
characters are t, b, l, and r.  To tell these information to generator,
operate as follows.

@display
                Read type(1).... 		p
                Acceptable characters:		tblr RET
@end display

  (B) is coordinate.  So its completion style is coOrd.  We want a prompt
meaning ``Maximum size'' when completion.

@display
                Read type(2)....		o
                Prompt for coordinates:		Max size RET
@end display

  That's all for optional argument.  Select quit.

@display
                Read type(3)....		q
@end display

  Then the generated option add-in function for \epsinput will be shown in
the next window.

@subsubsection Generating ``argument add-in''
@cindex argument add-in

  Next, create the argument add-in.  The arguments for \epsinput are EPS
file name, framing style, and caption string in sequence.

@display
                M-x YaTeX-generate-simple RET
                epsinput RET
                a
@end display

  Above key strokes bring the prompt that asks the number of argument.
Answer it with 3.

@display
                How many arguments?: 3 RET
@end display

  Then the generator asks the completion style and prompt for completion.
Answer them.  @kbd{f} for FileName and prompt string.

@display
                Read type(1)....		f
                Prompt for argument#1		EPS file name RET
@end display

  The second argument is one of selected symbol.  So the completion type
is @code{Completion}.

@display
                Read type(2)....		c
                Prompt for argument#2		Include style RET
@end display

  Then all the candidates ready to be read.  Type single RET after
entering all.

@display
		Item[1](RET to exit):		plain RET
		Item[2](RET to exit):		frame RET
		Item[3](RET to exit):		dframe RET
		Item[4](RET to exit):		RET
@end display

  The following prompt asks whether the entered string must belong to
candidates or not.  In this case, since the argument must be one of
@code{plain}, @code{frame}, and @code{dframe}, type @code{y}.

@display
                Require match? (y or n)		y
@end display

  The last argument is the caption string for which any completion is
needed.

@display
                Read type(3)....		s
                Prompt for argument#3		Caption RET
                default:			Figure of RET
@end display

  Finally we'll get the argument add-in in the next window.

@subsection Contribution

  If you get your own pretty function and you let it be in public, please 
steel yourself in the happy atmosphere and do not send me the function.
I do know it is not fine because it is generated by yatexgen:-p.

  The standard completion  tables provided  in @file{yatex.el} contain  a
few La@TeX{}  commands  I frequently use.  This is  to lessen the key
strokes to  complete  entire  word, because   too  many candidates
rarely used  often cause too many  hits.   Therefore always try to
use completion  in order to  enrich your dictionary,  and you will
also find `Wild Bird' growing suitable for your La@TeX{} style.

  The package name `Wild Bird' is the English translation of Japanese
title `Yachou', which is a trick on words of Japanese.
