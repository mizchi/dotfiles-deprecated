		      SAS on compute.temple.edu

SAS runs on the unix machine compute.temple.edu.  You can get a compute
account by going to the ground floor of the computer center and filling
out a form at the help desk.  You need to have an astro account.
The help desk is open until 7:30 weekdays.


SAS can be run as a batch program on compute.temple.edu from any computer.

SETUP

The first time you use compute enter the command
    /home/public/stat/stat.setup
at the shell prompt.  This sets up compute to look the way I want it to
look.  It tells us where SAS is, and sets up some sas defaults.


SIMPLEST INSTRUCTIONS

  Telnet to compute and login.

  Create a file myfile.sas on compute, either by editing it there or
by ftping it from your pc.

  From the shell prompt, enter
     sas myfile

  On completion, you will have two new files, myfile.log and
myfile.lst.  Look at them and correct if necessary.

  For graphs, you will need to use postscript.  There is no
interactive graphics through telnet.  Include the following 4 lines in
your sas file:

/* required goptions for batch files */
/* comment out these lines for interactive use on X-terminals*/
filename grafout 'myfile.ps';
goptions device=ps gsfname=grafout gsfmode=replace gaccess=sasgastd;
 
On completion, ftp the myfile.ps back to your pc and look at it with gsview.
You can print it from the gsview window.



BETTER INSTRUCTIONS

Work from within NTemacs on you PC.

1. Edit the file and save it on compute with C-x C-w as
  /name@compute:myfile.sas
for example, to construct a recent homework I used
  /rmh@compute:ex2017.sas


2. From within NTemacs (with my setup)

   M-x S+elsewhere
This opens a buffer named *S+3* running a bash shell.  Type

   d:/Apps/emacs/telnet/telnet.exe compute
This connects you to compute (compute.temple.edu) and is ready for login.

Login to compute from the *S+3* shell.


3. load the file ess-compute-sas.el into emacs with the command
   M-x load-file RET ess-compute-sas.el
(The file ess-compute-sas.el is on blackboard.)

This gives you the following function keys
  "PC-like SAS key definitions"
[f2] 'ess-revert-wisely
[f3] 'shell
[f4] 'ess-sas-goto-file-1
[f5] 'ess-sas-goto-sas
[f6] 'ess-sas-goto-log
[f7] 'ess-sas-goto-lst
[f8] 'ess-sas-submit


4. Edit myfile.sas in an emacs buffer.  When you are ready press f8 to
save and submit it.  Press f6 for the log file and f7 for the lst
file.  Cycle through these keys until the output is right.


5.  The files are all saved on the remote machine.  To save a copy to
your PC, open a dired buffer on the remote machine
  C-x C-d /name@compute:
and another on the local machine
  C-x C-d ~/503.f00

Put the cursor on the file name in the remote file, type C (Uppercase C).
You will be prompted for a destination with the remote machine as default.
Change it to
   ~/503.f00
and press enter.

A copy of the file is now on the local machine.
